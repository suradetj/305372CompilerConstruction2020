# 305372 Compiler Construction

This is a collection of lab exercises and homework assignments for the course
305372 Compiler Construction by [**Suradet Jitprapaikulsarn**][me] at
[**Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering**][nu-ecpe],
[**Faculty of Engineering**][nu-eng], [**Naresuan University**][nu],
Phitsanulok, Thailand (http://www.ecpe.nu.ac.th/suradet/).

The sample codes are implemented in the ObjFPC (Object Pascal, Free Pascal)
dialect of the Pascal programming language.  The rationales behind the decision
are
* By being unfamiliar to the sample implementation language, the learners may
try to do the exercises by themselves instead of just reading the codes from
the samples.
* The language is quite readable.
* The Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) is available on a lot of platforms.
